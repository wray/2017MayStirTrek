# Essential JWT #

## Todd Nussbaum ##

Working with RESTful services, and wondering how to secure them? You aren't alone. No one solution works everywhere, but JSON Web Tokens provide a simple and flexible solution for a lot of use cases. JSON Web Tokens are stateless, do not require cookies in the browser, and do not require CSRF protection. They allow the user to identify themselves upon multiple requests, and can be used as the basis for a number of different authentication and authorization schemes. In this talk, we'll look at JSON Web Tokens and what makes them special. A simple Java application with integrated Spring Security will serve as the backdrop for explaining how to build a solution around JSON Web Tokens and how to use them effectively.
